### Front End App Development 💻

As a Software Engineering Intern at Meta, I contributed to the development of the Facebook Rooms product, a video chat platform for iOS. I integrated the app’s engine with **Apple’s Software Development Kit**, to enable screen sharing functionality natively within the app. My work involved programming in **Objective-C** and **C++**, to enhance the usability and functionality of the product.
